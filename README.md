## 1.An online degree is an academic degree that can be earned primarily or entirely through the use of an Internet-connected computer, rather than attending college in a traditional campus setting.


## 2.Online education enables individuals living with physical disabilities, full-time employees, military personnel, those living abroad, and stay-at-home parents, among others to have access to accredited higher education. 

## 3.The perception of the quality of online degrees compared to on-campus degrees varies, but has been increasing in recent years. While most major online colleges are regionally accredited, the public estimation of their quality is in dispute. A national survey of hiring representatives showed that a preference toward on-campus degrees exists. In some instances, hiring executives were unwilling to consider applicants with an online degree. [6] Some experts argue that degrees in certain fields are more accepted online than in others, while some programs are less suited for online-only schools.[7] A major issue for accredited and reputable online programs is the proliferation of proprietary online-only programs that have come under fire in recent years
